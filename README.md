# Pandas-Challenge

Just wanted to give you a heads up that this isn't complete. I've had a really busy week and hit a big mental block early on that I didn't have much of a breakthrough on until today. This isn't going to be a habit, but I wanted to turn something in to prove I didn't just ignore the deadline altogether.
I could write the analysis part now, but that's the easy part for me and I'd rather wait to build all the summary frames required for the last few sections so I have full information.
